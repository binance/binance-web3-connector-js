This is a client library for the Binance Web3 Wallet API, enabling developers to interact programmatically with Binance's Web3 Wallet platform. The library provides tools to programmatically leverage Binance in-house algorithmic trading capability to automate order execution strategy, improve execution transparency and give users smart access to the available market liquidity through the REST API:

- [REST API](./src/rest-api/rest-api.ts)

## Installation

To use this library, ensure your environment is running Node.js version **22.12.0** or later. If you're using `nvm` (Node Version Manager), you can set the correct version as follows:

```bash
nvm install 22.12.0
nvm use 22.12.0
```

Then install the library using `npm`:

```bash
npm install @binance-web3/wallet
```

## Documentation

For detailed information, refer to the [Binance API Documentation](https://web3.binance.com/en/dev-docs).

### REST APIs

All REST API endpoints are available through the [`rest-api`](./src/rest-api/rest-api.ts) module. Note that some endpoints require authentication using your Binance API credentials.

```typescript
import { Web3Wallet, Web3WalletRestAPI } from '@binance-web3/wallet';

const configurationRestAPI = {
    apiKey: 'your-api-key',
    apiSecret: 'your-api-secret',
};
const client = new Web3Wallet({ configurationRestAPI });

client.restAPI
    .getPriceInfo()
    .then((res) => res.data())
    .then((data: Web3WalletRestAPI.GetPriceInfoResponse) => console.log(data))
    .catch((err) => console.error(err));
```

More examples can be found in the [`examples/rest-api`](./examples/rest-api/) folder.

#### Configuration Options

The REST API supports the following advanced configuration options:

- `timeout`: Timeout for requests in milliseconds (default: 1000 ms).
- `proxy`: Proxy configuration:
  - `host`: Proxy server hostname.
  - `port`: Proxy server port.
  - `protocol`: Proxy protocol (http or https).
  - `auth`: Proxy authentication credentials:
    - `username`: Proxy username.
    - `password`: Proxy password.
- `keepAlive`: Enable HTTP keep-alive (default: true).
- `compression`: Enable response compression (default: true).
- `retries`: Number of retry attempts for failed requests (default: 3).
- `backoff`: Delay in milliseconds between retries (default: 1000 ms).
- `httpsAgent`: Custom HTTPS agent for advanced TLS configuration.
- `privateKey`: RSA or ED25519 private key for authentication.
- `privateKeyPassphrase`: Passphrase for the private key, if encrypted.

##### Timeout

You can configure a timeout for requests in milliseconds. If the request exceeds the specified timeout, it will be aborted. See the [Timeout example](./docs/rest-api/timeout.md) for detailed usage.

##### Proxy

The REST API supports HTTP/HTTPS proxy configurations. See the [Proxy example](./docs/rest-api/proxy.md) for detailed usage.

##### Keep-Alive

Enable HTTP keep-alive for persistent connections. See the [Keep-Alive example](./docs/rest-api/keepAlive.md) for detailed usage.

##### Compression

Enable or disable response compression. See the [Compression example](./docs/rest-api/compression.md) for detailed usage.

##### Retries

Configure the number of retry attempts and delay in milliseconds between retries for failed requests. See the [Retries example](./docs/rest-api/retries.md) for detailed usage.

##### HTTPS Agent

Customize the HTTPS agent for advanced TLS configurations. See the [HTTPS Agent example](./docs/rest-api/httpsAgent.md) for detailed usage.

##### Key Pair Based Authentication

The REST API supports key pair-based authentication for secure communication. You can use `RSA` or `ED25519` keys for signing requests. See the [Key Pair Based Authentication example](./docs/rest-api/key-pair-authentication.md) for detailed usage.

##### Certificate Pinning

To enhance security, you can use certificate pinning with the `httpsAgent` option in the configuration. This ensures the client only communicates with servers using specific certificates. See the [Certificate Pinning example](./docs/rest-api/certificate-pinning.md) for detailed usage.

#### Error Handling

The REST API provides detailed error types to help you handle issues effectively:

- `ConnectorClientError`: General client error.
- `RequiredError`: Thrown when a required parameter is missing.
- `UnauthorizedError`: Indicates missing or invalid authentication credentials.
- `ForbiddenError`: Access to the requested resource is forbidden.
- `TooManyRequestsError`: Rate limit exceeded.
- `RateLimitBanError`: IP address banned for exceeding rate limits.
- `ServerError`: Internal server error.
- `NetworkError`: Issues with network connectivity.
- `NotFoundError`: Resource not found.
- `BadRequestError`: Invalid request.

See the [Error Handling example](./docs/rest-api/error-handling.md) for detailed usage.

If `basePath` is not provided, it defaults to `https://web3.binance.com/build`.

## Testing

To run the tests:

```bash
npm install

npm run test
```

The tests cover:

- REST API endpoints
- Error handling and edge cases
